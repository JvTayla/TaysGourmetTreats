            <p>
              Tay's Gourmet Treats started at the kitchen table with a whisk, a
              recipe book, and a very patient mum. We believe treats taste
              better with a story, that's why every cake is hand-decorated and
              every cookie is made to feel like a hug.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our owner, <strong>Jordyn Van Aswegen</strong>, started this
              business in 2024 during her 2nd year at university while studying
              Digital Art and Game Design. She began baking as a way to get back
              to her roots and to make some extra money as a university student.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our small team which is mostly a mix of Jordyn and her unpaid
              interns (family) loves to mix family recipes with modern flavours
              and can design everything from classic sugar cookies to bold party
              centrepieces. We pride ourselves on friendly service, clear
              communication, and delicious results.

            <p>
              At Tay's Gourmet Treats, we believe that every celebration
              deserves something beautiful, personal, and unforgettable. What
              began in 2024 as a student's side project — armed with a whisk, a
              dream, and a love for design — has grown into a heartfelt mission
              to make life's sweetest moments even sweeter.
            </p>

            <p>
              We create Bento Cakes and Themed Cakes that don't just look good —
              they feel right. Every treat is designed to match the soul and
              aesthetic of your event, bringing together artistry, taste, and
              story in every slice.
            </p>

            <p><strong>We believe in:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Quality without compromise:</strong> Every ingredient,
                every detail, and every swirl of frosting reflects our promise
                of excellence.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Creativity with purpose:</strong> Each cake tells a
                story — your story — expressed through color, texture, and
                design.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Empowerment through creation:</strong> Tay's isn't just
                about baking; it's about inspiring others to find joy and pride
                in what they make, share, and celebrate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Community and connection:</strong> Though we began as an
                at-home bakery, our dream is to grow into a storefront where
                creativity, kindness, and good taste live side by side.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We're still small, but our ambitions are big. We see a future
              where Tay's Gourmet Treats becomes a household name — a place
              where every person feels welcome, every flavor has a story, and
              every order carries a touch of love and craftsmanship.
            </p>

            <p>
              Because to us, baking isn't just about sugar and flour. It's about
              creating moments — the kind you can taste, share, and remember.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Tay's Gourmet Treats</strong><br />Handcrafted with heart.
              Shared with joy.
