            Tay’s Gourmet Treats started at the kitchen table with a whisk, a
            recipe book, and a very patient mum. We believe treats taste better
            with a story , that’s why every cake is hand-decorated and every
            cookie is made to feel like a hug.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our owner, <strong>Jordyn Van Aswegen</strong>, started this
            business in 2024 during her 2nd year at university while studying
            Digital Art and Game Design. She began baking as a way to get back
            to her roots and to make some extra money as a university student.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our small team which is mostly a mix of Jordyn and her unpaid
            interns (family) loves to mix family recipes with modern flavours
            and can design everything from classic sugar cookies to bold party
            centrepieces. We pride ourselves on friendly service, clear
            communication, and delicious results.

          <p>
            At Tay’s Gourmet Treats, we believe that every celebration deserves
            something beautiful, personal, and unforgettable. What began in 2024
            as a student’s side project — armed with a whisk, a dream, and a
            love for design — has grown into a heartfelt mission to make life’s
            sweetest moments even sweeter.
          </p>

          <p>
            We create Bento Cakes and Themed Cakes that don’t just look good —
            they feel right. Every treat is designed to match the soul and
            aesthetic of your event, bringing together artistry, taste, and
            story in every slice.
          </p>

          <p><strong>We believe in:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Quality without compromise:</strong> Every ingredient,
              every detail, and every swirl of frosting reflects our promise of
              excellence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Creativity with purpose:</strong> Each cake tells a story
              — your story — expressed through color, texture, and design.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Empowerment through creation:</strong> Tay’s isn’t just
              about baking; it’s about inspiring others to find joy and pride in
              what they make, share, and celebrate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Community and connection:</strong> Though we began as an
              at-home bakery, our dream is to grow into a storefront where
              creativity, kindness, and good taste live side by side.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We’re still small, but our ambitions are big. We see a future where
            Tay’s Gourmet Treats becomes a household name — a place where every
            person feels welcome, every flavor has a story, and every order
            carries a touch of love and craftsmanship.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because to us, baking isn’t just about sugar and flour. It’s about
            creating moments — the kind you can taste, share, and remember.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Tay’s Gourmet Treats</strong><br />Handcrafted with heart.
            Shared with joy.
